This is a simple and interactive Expense Counter webpage built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to track their expenses by selecting a category, entering an amount, and viewing a running total of all expenses. Each entry appears in a list with an option to delete it, which also updates the total dynamically. The interface is clean, responsive, and easy to use.
