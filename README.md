This is a simple Expense Counter web app built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It lets users select a category (like Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.), enter an expense amount, and view a running total of their expenses. Each entry is listed with the option to remove it, which also updates the total. The app features a clean, responsive design using Bootstrap and provides a straightforward way to manage daily spending.
